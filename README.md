# roman_numerals
West-End Ruby Hack Project  11/17/2015

The purpose of this project was to choose an Exercism Kata and implement it in an ad-hoc team during the evening's session.

roman_numerals.rb is the work of Blake Strickland, Tyler Rockwell, and Greg Tarsa
roman_numerals_test.rb came from [the Exercism site](https://github.com/exercism/xruby/blob/master/roman-numerals/roman_numerals_test.rb)

roman_numerals2.rb is a quick Ruby of a Java solution that I (Greg) found in a quick post-event web search.  It is not an object oriented solution, but it is pretty elegant.  roman_numerals2_test.rb is a quick edit of the test program with all the tests green.

Thanks to TJ Stankus for organizing the Hack Night
